                        My name is Saliha Popal. I am going to share my story about (My journey from Kabul to London). 
                        I left my hometown, Kabul (where I was born, grew up, experienced ups and downs with my family, shared happiness and sorrow with relatives and neighbours) when the former dominion collapsed, 
                        and you may know the rest.

                        Despite the continuing war, we lived there happily and had all which are essential for a successful life. All those pleasant memories are unforgettable and will always be in my mind.
                        As the saying goes: "Every bird loves its nest."

                    <p>
                        Balkh Province situates in the northeast of Afghanistan. There are spectacular historical places. One of them is Mazar i Sharif,
                        the centre of the Balkh province where the beautiful Blue Mosque is situated. Unfortunately, I had been there for the first time when I
                        had to leave the country towards London. Despite feeling sad, I enjoyed visiting there and took some pictures that I want to share of them with you.

                    <p>
                        After one week's stay in a hotel in Mazar, I arrived in Athens. Living in Athens was short and a new experience for me. I lived in a high and beautiful place called (Panagidi). 
                        From (Attica Grove) I always saw the breathtaking panorama of Athens.
                        Undoubtedly, Greece is one of the most seeable countries in the world with spectacular views, high and jungly mountains, beautiful beaches and many more. 
                        I had been there for almost two months, so I had the chance to visit some popular and historical places like Acropolis, 
                        Parthenon, Mount Lycabettus, Athens beaches and many more beautiful places.

                    <p>
                        After receiving the UK visa, We arrived in London on the 12th of November. We were welcomed by many friends and my cousin and his wife at the airport with beautiful bouquets. 
                        We have been living here for more than one year. Since June, I have joined ESOL classes at Morley College to enhance my English language. 
                        It helps me with (coding classes in CYF) which I have been learning since last March, and improves my communication and learning skills. 
                        It continues, and I am going to complete it next year. 
                        Starting a new life from scratch is more challenging, but it is not impossible when I have the willpower to achieve my goal, so I am trying to get to new customs and environments as soon as possible. 
                        Fortunately, I have made many new friends who help me find the way and prepare to begin a new life. I hope my teachers and my efforts eventuate so I can live here normally.
